The situation should be a livelock.

The difference between deadlock and livelock is whether ths event that processes are waiting could/will happen.
In the movie, all angels are waiting because they ware looking at each other and wait for other angel to stop
looking at them. Similar to the "you go first" problem in the note, by removing one angel from the cycle, the lock
issue is solved.
